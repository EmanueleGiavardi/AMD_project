# AMD_project
Final project for the Algorithms for Massive Datasets course @Unimi

The values of the free variables are already set to reproduce the experiments described in the report.
However, it may be desirable to run the procedure:

- by changing the value of the `sampling_frac` variable to use a smaller or larger sample of the original dataset,
- by changing the value of the `topic` variable to compute the ranking scores on different genres or literary categories,
- by changing the value of `k` to display a larger window of the users with the highest PageRank scores.

To run the procedure, execute all the cells starting from the first one.

**NOTE**: at the beginning of the procedure, you will be prompted to upload your own `kaggle.json` file containing the access credentials for Kaggle, necessary for downloading the dataset.
